## Overview

This repository contains a collection of DSA problems organized by topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc. Each problem is followed by its solution, along with explanations and insights where applicable. The goal is to provide a resource that can help you to develop a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms and prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming contests, or simply improve your coding skills.

## Problem Categories

The problems are grouped into the following categories:

1. **Arrays**
   - Problem-solving related to arrays, such as finding the maximum element, subarrays, sorting, etc.

2. **Strings**
   - String manipulation, pattern matching, palindromes, substring search, etc.

3. **Linked Lists**
   - Solving problems with singly and doubly linked lists, such as reversal, merging, and detecting cycles.

4. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Problems related to the stack and queue data structures, including implementation and problem-solving (e.g., balanced parentheses, next greater element).

5. **Trees and Binary Trees**
   - Binary tree traversal, height of a tree, level-order traversal, binary search trees, and more.

6. **Graphs**
   - Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms, finding cycles, etc.

7. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Problems requiring dynamic programming techniques, such as the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.

8. **Sorting and Searching**
   - Various sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, etc.) and searching techniques (binary search, linear search).

9. **Greedy Algorithms**
   - Problems where greedy techniques can be applied (e.g., activity selection, coin change problem).

10. **Backtracking**
    - Problems that involve backtracking algorithms (e.g., n-queens, permutation generation).

11. **Recursion**
    - Problems that require recursive thinking, such as factorial, Fibonacci, etc.
